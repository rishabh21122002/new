### I think I found a bug

1. Review the issues in the [Issue Tracker &nearr;](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular/issues). Maybe someone has already reported it and it will be fixed soon.
1. The problem might have also been fixed. In this case, you will find the issue in [the closed issues list &nearr;](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
1. If you cannot find your issue, [follow the reproduction steps guide below](#i-want-to-report-a-bug). We will look into it.

### I want to report a bug

1. Find an example in [the documentation](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/) that looks similar to your case.
1. Open it in Plunker by using the **OPEN AS PLUNKER** button.
1. Modify the plunk, so that the issue is reproducible in it. Try to include the minimum possible amount of code.
1. Save the plunk by using the blue **Save** button at the top.
1. Copy the link from the address bar of the browser.
1. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular/issues/new) and add the plunker link in the description.
1. Provide any additional information necessary for us to reproduce the problem&mdash;for example, browser version, steps to perform, etc.

We might not be able to act on issues **without a runnable demo**.

If you need assistance on troubleshooting or isolating a problem, you can request a remote assistance session through our [Support Ticket](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-tickets) system. Remote Assistance is included in the [DevCraft Ultimate](http://www.telerik.com/purchase/kendo-ui) subscription.

### I need a tailor-made solution

Our aim is to provide the most versatile and proven set of application building blocks. Still, depending on the functionality you desire, some assembly is required.

The [Progress Services](https://www.progress.com/services) team is available to assist in building functional blocks or complete applications according to your specification. They will help you make the most of Kendo UI while freeing you to work on the real business problems.
