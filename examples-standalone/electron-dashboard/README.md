# Using the Suite with Electron

This Kendo UI for Angular sample project demonstrates how to use [Kendo UI for Angular components](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components) in an Electron Desktop application and is based on the https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron Electron and Angular integration project.

## Setting Up the Project

Bootstrap and package your project with Angular 5 or later and Electron (Typescript, SASS, and Hot Reload) for creating Desktop applications.

Currently, the sample projects runs with:
- Angular v7.x
- Angular-CLI
- Electron v1.8.6
- Electron Builder v20.0.4

With this sample project, you can:
- Run your application in a local development environment with Electron and Hot Reload.
- Run your application in a production environment.
- Package your application into an executable file for Linux, Windows, and Mac.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository of the sample application locally by running `git clone https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular/.git`.
1. Navigate to the project folder by running `cd examples-standalone/kendo-angular-electron-dashboard`.
1. Install dependencies with NPM by running `npm install`.

  > * An issue occurs when `yarn` and `node_modules` are only used in Electron on the backend when the application is built by the packager. To work around the problem, use `npm` as your dependency manager.
  > * To generate Angular components with Angular-CLI, you have to install `@angular/cli` in an NPM global context. Run `npm install -g @angular/cli`. If you had installed an earlier version of `angular-cli`, follow the instruction in the [Angular-CLI documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) .

## Building for Development

In the terminal window, run `npm start`. Voila! You can use your Angular and Electron application in a local development environment with hot reload!

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample project, the application runs with a simple Angular Application (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window. The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import. You can deactivate **Developer Tools** by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## Managing Your Environment Variables

- To use local variables, run `npm start` or `cross-env ENV=local npm start`.
- To use development variables, run `cross-env ENV=dev npm start`.
- To use production variables, run `cross-env ENV=rod npm start`.

## Browser Mode

To execute the application in the browser (WITHOUT HOT RELOAD ACTUALLY...), you can run `npm run ng:serve`. Note that you cannot use Electron or NodeJS native libraries in this case. To watch how conditional import of Electron and Native libraries is done, refer to `providers/electron.service.ts` .
