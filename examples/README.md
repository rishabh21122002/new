# Example Projects

This folder contains example projects from the [Kendo UI for Angular Documentation](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components) in a shared [Angular CLI Workspace](https://angular.io/guide/file-structure).

Additional sample applications, that can't use the same workspace, can be found in the [examples-standalone](../examples-standalone) folder.

## Starting Projects

Instructions for starting each sample project can be found in it's README.md file in the [projects folder](./projects).

## Creating a New Project

1. Use `ng generate application <application-name>` to create a new sample application.
1. Add the Kendo UI Default theme to the `styles` section of the application in `angular.json`

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
