# Example Projects

This folder holds an [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) workspace with sample projects from the Kendo UI for Angular [documentation](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components).

Also, check out the [Standalone Examples](../examples-standalone) 

## Starting Sample Projects

To run the sample projects, change into the `projects/<project name>` folder and run `npm start`. Alternatively, run `ng serve <project name>`.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Creating a New Sample Project

1. Use `ng generate application <application-name>` to create a new sample application.
1. Add the Kendo UI Default theme to the `styles` section of the application in `angular.json`
